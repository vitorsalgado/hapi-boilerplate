Boilerplate project based on Hapi.  
The goal is to have a base from where one can start a new project with all basic, common and boring stuff already set.  
This project is very opinionated and contains several architecture experiments.

## Code Quality
This project integrates a combination of unit tests, code analysis tools and security checkups for dependencies which are all integrated in a 
continuous integratio pipeline.  
Check `package.json` scripts section and `.travis.yml` for more details.
